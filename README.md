This repo contains code for paper [Concept Algebra for Text-Controlled Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03693.pdf)

`concept-algebra.ipynb` ([colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zihao12/concept-algebra/blob/main/concept-algebra.ipynb)) gives a minimalist demonstration of concept transfer and concept projection with stable diffusion. This demo uses a more memory efficient stable diffusion to allow it to be easily run on public colabs, so results do not exactly match the paper.
