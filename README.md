concept-algebra.ipynb gives a minimalist demonstration of concept transfer and concept projection with stable diffusion. This demo uses a more memory efficient stable diffusion to allow it to be easily run on public colabs, so results do not exactly match the paper.

Code used to produce the figures in the paper is available in the paper-code folder.
